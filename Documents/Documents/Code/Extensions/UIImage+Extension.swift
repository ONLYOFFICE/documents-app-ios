    /// - Important:
    ///   Use this method to convert data:// URLs to UIImage objects.
    ///   Don't use this synchronous initializer to request network-based URLs. For network-based URLs, this method can block the current thread for tens of seconds on a slow network, resulting in a poor user experience, and in iOS, may cause your app to be terminated.
    ///   Instead, for non-file URLs, consider using this in an asynchronous way, using `dataTask(with:completionHandler:)` method of the URLSession class or a library such as `AlamofireImage`, `Kingfisher`, `SDWebImage`, or others to perform asynchronous network image loading.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: a `URL`, representing the image location
    ///   - scale: The scale factor to assume when interpreting the image data created from the URL. Applying a scale factor of 1.0 results in an image whose size matches the pixel-based dimensions of the image. Applying a different scale factor changes the size of the image as reported by the `size` property.
